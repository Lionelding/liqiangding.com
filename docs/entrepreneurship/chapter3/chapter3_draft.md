### Business Model and Pricing

Our logic:
Audioflo's focus is not to develop the best TTS model in the world. Instead, we work as an end-to-end solution that work with many tech companies and aggregate all powerful TTS models that has studio-quality voices. SO there our users can access to all of them within one platform.

Credit system
This means, different voices, would have different expenses to use. To normalize cost, we used a credit system, and charge user based on number of characters multiplying different buring rate depending on the choices of voices.


Transcation-based
Credit add-on to buy
* 59.99 per 5M credits, access to 20 studio-grade voices

Subscription-based
* 59.99 per month, 5M credits, access to 30 studio-grade voices

5M credits is enough for an 8-hour audiobook
