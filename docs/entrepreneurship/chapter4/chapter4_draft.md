# Chapter 4: Product Design - Building UX That Authors Actually Want to Use

### Design principles
Since our users are authors whose age are cross from 30 to 65+, we need to make sure the User experience is friendly to all of them:
1. Break a complex process to simpler steps
2. Feedbacks are the key so that they know they are on the track
2. Being transparent about credit usage

### 1. Start Simple, Add Details Later
* Simple upload flow that reveals complexity only when needed
* Dashboard shows summary cards initially, detailed charts available in separate tabs
* Custom Voice creation uses a step-by-step wizard instead of one overwhelming form

### 2. Visual feedbacks
* Real-time conversion progress tracking
* Color-coded status badges (green=completed, yellow=pending, blue=processing, red=failed)
* Email Notification

### 3. Credit Transparency
* Clear display of credit costs before actions
* Visual breakdown of plan vs addon credit usage
* "Upgrade Required" dialog shows exactly what users get

### 4. Mobile-First Responsive
* Grid layouts that adapt from 1 to 4 columns
* Touch-friendly button sizes
* Collapsible navigation for small screens

### 5. Contextual Help
* FAQ sections embedded in relevant pages

### 6. Team Collaboration Focus
* Role-based UI (admins see more options)
