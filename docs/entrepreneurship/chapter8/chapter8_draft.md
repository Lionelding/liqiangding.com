# Chapter 8: Marketing and Sale Funnel

### Principal
Building a product is easy. Selling it is hard.

The mentality is to help the customers solve their problems, instead of selling the product. 

### Distribution Channels

There are multiple distribution channels available to attract potentail customers. However, people comes into each channel usually with a different purpose. I found that it would be more effective to gain customers if spin the marketing campagin based on the mentatliyt of the customers. 

1. Writing Forum
* Writing Forum
* Reddit subreddit

what are these for: 
- indie authors visit these websites to ask questions, share drafting, ask for review from beta readers.

Focus:
- Human side: People tend to trust a product more if they talked to me personally
- Thinking from Authors' shoes: Built a stronger trust when they know me an indie author too. 
- Watch-out: People hate coorproate-like marketing compaigns. This will lose their interests immediately.


2. Social Media
* Instagram
* Facebook group
* Twitter
* Good reads

what are these for: 
- indie authors usuually use these platforms for marketing. 
- Users are in pitch-mode. 
- most of them focus on promoting their own books

Focus

3. Searching Engine

### Customer Conversion Strategy
1. Free trial

These days, most of SaaS services and online products ask users to try their services for free first.
This is the opportunies for the users to build trust on the product, and the development team behind. 
Most of authors will only subscribe to the paid plans, only after trying the free versions.

2. Compromise on quantity vs Compromise on Quality.
It is never a good idea to compromise on quality. Because it would be very hard for users to imagine how good the paid services vs the Free services. 
And it is even harder for them to confirm this. 

Instead, it is ok to compromise quantity. For example, we chose to open all of AudioFlo features to the users no matter if they are paid customers. 
The audio outputs they receive, are always in the top-quality. We restrict the number of words on the total number of words. (For example, only the first chapter of their books)

This way, the user get an idea of the full feature we provide. They are more likely to pay because they want to extend this service to the whole book.

3. Special-perks for paid customers
We also emphasize the special-perks that a paid customer will benefit. These features are add-on features that make their books even next level or faciliate their submission proces.

These include:
- Custom voice clone if they want to narrate books with their own voices (Product)
- Additinoal credits for longer books. (Product)
- Full guidance for submitting their audiobooks on the distribution platforms. (Service)
- VIP customer help with manual script editting (Service)
- Priority on chapter conversion (Service)

4. Improve discoveryability
