## Artificial Intelligence? Computer Vision? Natural language Processing?

Artificial Intelligence never fails to appeal to me. 

Just like Doraemon to Nobita Nobi <img style="float: right;" src="./img/Doraemon.jpeg", width="200" height="300">, 
I have been dreaming of having a computer friend since I was a kid. It has a bunch of fancy inventions from the 22nd century in his four dimension pocket, 
joins me on the adventure exploring this world, and most importantly, teaches by honest words and actions instead of banalities. 
For years, I scratched numerous drafts about how it would look like, imagined the fancy capabilities it might have, and even came up with scenarios where it could come to realities
without scaring my parents. Well, most of them is lost in time, but the fantasy for building such a powerful program still sticks to my mind.

Finished the elementary school and high school in China, I was fortunate to came aboard to Canada to continue my study at McGill University, majoring in eletrical engineering.
Studying at McGill really broadened my horizons, and it was the real starting point for me to get to know programming algorithms, electrical circuits, information theory and a lot of cool stuff. 
Being exposure to this massive amount of new knowledge is an exciting yet challenging journey, and no need for mentioning how many nights spent in the Schulich library.
However, there was always one question confusing me: What do **I** want to do with these great pieces of knowledge? 
Trying to find this answer, I took a few internships across different industries, with various technical focuses. 
I witnessed how teams across the world leveraged their own experties, contributing to making a great product that faciliated millions of people. 
I was also amazed to see that people were willing to spend days in improving browsers just to render contents with 1 second faster.
On one side, all of these experiences pushed me to go further with my study, and opened completely new worlds. 
On the other side, they also deepened my question. Time is limited, decisions need to be made.

In the last year of my bachelor study, one of my friends mentioned me a course of computer vision that he was about to take.
For curiosity, I clicked the course website in the evening, and was greatly surprised of the cool things that it can do.
For the first time I know, computer algorithm is not only used to sort an array or to design the shortest path for a busy postman. 
Instead, it can be so connected to the daily pictures we take, to recognize a poker card, to restore an old image, and even to stabilize poor-taken videos from amateurs.
After a few assignments, I was really fascinated by these algorithms behind it.
